Title: About

My name is Adam Krieger.

I've been in the IT industry since 2007, and in that time I've been through Technical Support, Software Development, Operations, Team Leadership, and Solutions Architecture roles. I've worked with Startups and Enterprises, and a variety of company sizes in between. I stay current by reading, writing, speaking, training, and experimenting. I care about my work, the people using it, and the people that work with me, and that's why I have this blog. This is an outlet for ideas and experiences which I hope will be valuable to the reader.

I'm also interested in Economics, Music, Math, Science, Product Design, and Architecture. Here's a short list of the topics I'm currently investigating.

* Microservices
* DevOps
* GoLang
* Amazon Web Services
* Information Security
* Staying Fit
* Woodworking
* Playing the Piano

Thanks for reading.
