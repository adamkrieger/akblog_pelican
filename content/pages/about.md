Title: About

Welcome to my personal blog. You'll find discussions and examples of functional and concurrent programming, and opinions about how software gets built.

Here are some of the more specific topics I'm currently diving into:

* Elixir
* Erlang
* Choice Architecture
* Continuous Delivery
* Functional Programming

I've been professionally developing software since 2007, and I believe it's my responsibility to share what I've learned with the community. I also have a responsibility to accept new ideas freely and continuously improve my skills. There are too many frameworks, too many languages, and too many paradigms for one person to achieve proficiency in. We will only succeed through targeted improvement and generous teamwork.

Thanks for reading.
